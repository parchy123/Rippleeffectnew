It is a versatile command line tool that lets you communicate with an emulator instances or connected android-powered device.it is a client server program that includes three components:-
1.A client
2.A Daemon
3.A server



How adb works?

when we start an adb client,the client first checks whether there is an adb server process already running .the server then sets up connection to all running emulator/device instances.it locates emulator/device instances by scanning odd-numbered ports in the range 5555 to 5585,the range used by emulator/devices.when the server finds an adb daemon,it sets up a connection to that port.
